Kya [Narrating.] Water, earth, fire, air. My grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days. How the four nations once lived in harmony. How everything changed once the Fire Nation attacked. Only the Avatar mastered all four elements. Only he could stop the ruthless firebenders. But when the world needed him most, he disappeared. Nobody had seen him for a hundred years, until my brother and I found him: an airbender named Aang. The problem is this Avatar is still a kid and even though his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. The Fire Nation will do anything to capture Aang before he masters all four elements. So, I must keep him safe until he is ready to fulfill his destiny. My brother thinks I'm crazy, but I believe Aang can save the world.
The episode starts with a shot of the sun. The camera pans down to Aang, Kya, and Sokka on a flying bison being followed by a boat.

Sokka   [Poking Aang with the tip of his boomerang.] So find it. I'm hungry.

Aang    Me? I, uh, I was just watching you. You know, trying to learn your technique.
Kya [Close-up.] This is your bison. You taught me.
Aang    [Frontal view of the two.] Yep, it appears I taught you well. And thus the master passes the reins to the pupil. [Presents her with a flower and bows.] Ancient tradition. [Kya grabs the flower and giggles, before throwing the flower away. Momo perks his ears up as if he hears something.] What do you hear, Momo?

Aang    [Frontal view.] You're important, too ... to me.

[To Momo.] Exactly, I can't let anything happen to Kya and Sokka. They're the only family I have, besides you.
